       db_stat - display DB statistics


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>db_stat</STRONG> [<STRONG>-lmt</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-d</STRONG> <STRONG>file</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-h</STRONG> <STRONG>home</STRONG>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <EM>db</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>stat</EM>  utility  displays statistics for DB environ-
       ments.

       The options are as follows:

       <STRONG>-d</STRONG>   Display  database  statistics   for   the   specified
            database, as described in <STRONG><A HREF="db_open.html">db_open(3)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>-h</STRONG>   Specify a home directory for the database.

       <STRONG>-l</STRONG>   Display   log   region  statistics  as  described  in
            <STRONG><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>-m</STRONG>   Display  shared  memory  buffer  pool  statistics  as
            described in <STRONG><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>-t</STRONG>   Display transaction region statistics as described in
            <STRONG><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></STRONG>.

       The <EM>db</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>stat</EM> utility attaches to DB shared memory  regions.
       In  order  to avoid region corruption, it should always be
       given the chance to detach and exit gracefully.  To  cause
       <EM>db</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>stat</EM>  to  clean  up  after  itself and exit, send it an
       interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The <EM>db</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>stat</EM> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
       occurs.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of <EM>db</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>stat</EM>:

       DB_HOME
            If the <STRONG>-h</STRONG> option is not specified and the environment
            variable  <EM>DB</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>HOME</EM>  is  set, it is used as the path of
            the database home, as described in <STRONG><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></STRONG>.

       The DB library is a family of  groups  of  functions  that
       provides  a  modular programming interface to transactions
       and record-oriented file  access.   The  library  includes
       support  for  transactions, locking, logging and file page
       caching, as well as various indexed access methods.   Many
       of  the  functional  groups  (e.g.,  the file page caching
       functions) are useful independent of the  other  DB  func-
       tions,  although  some  functional  groups  are explicitly
       based on other functional groups (e.g.,  transactions  and
