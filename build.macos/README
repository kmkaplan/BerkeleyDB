This is the Macintosh build directory for Metrowerks C (I used CodeWarrior
11) running under MPW.

To compile, you need 

 - The dmake MPW tool, available from 
 
ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch//software/platform/macos/src/mpw_c/dmake_40m2.sit.bin

 - The GUSI library, available from
 
ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch//software/platform/macos/src/mw_c/CWGUSI_180.sit.bin

 (by the time you read this, a later version of CWGUSI might be available).

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

dbtest doesn't really work well, partially because I didn't manage to get
a good build of Tcl with CWGUSI done. I therefore have excluded it from
the build.

Globally (inter-process) shared memory regions do not yet work, but should
get fixed soon.

The Mac port is not very throughly tested yet; I rely on your reports
(both positive and negative to improve it).
